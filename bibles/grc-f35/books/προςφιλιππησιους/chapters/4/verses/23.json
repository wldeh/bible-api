{"verse":"23","text":"Ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου,κυριου f35 ℵA,B [85%] RP,HF,OC,CP,NU ¦ 1 ημων 𝕻46 [15%] TR Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, μετὰ πάντωνπαντων f35 (90.9%) RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ του πνευματος 𝕻46ℵA,B (9.1%) NU ὑμῶν. Ἀμήν.αμην f35 𝕻46ℵA [98%] RP,HF,OC,TR,CP ¦ --- B [2%] NU,The citation of f35 is based on thirty-seven MSS—18, 35, 201, 204, 328, 386, 394, 444, 604, 757, 824, 928, 986, 1072, 1075, 1100, 1248, 1249, 1503, 1548, 1637, 1725, 1732, 1761, 1768, 1855, 1864, 1865, 1876, 1892, 1897, 2080, 2352, 2466, 2554, 2587 and 2723—all of which I collated myself. 35, 1072, 1864, 1865 and 2554 are ‘perfect’ representatives of f35 in Philippians, as they stand, as were the exemplars of another ten. The uniformity is impressive. Since these MSS come from all over the Mediterranean world (Sinai, Jerusalem, Patmos, Constantinople, Bucharest, Aegean, Trikala, Meteora, Athens, Mt. Athos [seven different monasteries], Grottaferrata, Vatican, etc.) they are certainly representative of the family, giving us the precise family profile—it is reflected in the Text without exception.In the statements of evidence I have included the percentage of manuscript attestation for each variant, within either ( ) or [ ]. I have used ( ) for the evidence taken from TuT, which I take to be reasonably precise. For the variant sets that are not covered there I had to revert to von Soden and the apparatus of N-A27, supplementing from other sources where possible (Scrivener and Tischendorf)—the percentages offered, I have used [ ] for these, are extrapolations based on a comparison of these sources.I venture to predict, if complete collations ever become available, that for any non-Byzantine variants listed with 5 to 1% support (in my apparatus) the margin of error should not exceed ±1%; for non-Byzantine variants listed with 10 to 6% support the margin of error should hardly exceed ±3%; where there is some division among the Byzantine witnesses the margin of error should rarely exceed ±15%. However, I guarantee the witness of Family 35. Please see the last footnote for Matthew for further information."}
