{"verse":"21","text":"Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, the leaders, and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came out of his own body32:21 i.e., his own sons killed him there with the sword."}
