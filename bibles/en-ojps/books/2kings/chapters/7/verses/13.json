{"verse":"13","text":"And one of his servants answered and said: 'Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city — behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed — and let us send and see.'"}
