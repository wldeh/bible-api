{"verse":"4","text":"John started baptizing in the wildernessHe was ‘preparing the way of the Lord’, and doing so in the wilderness. and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.There are those who squirm at the plain meaning of the Text—John was offering forgiveness of sins. Well, throughout the Old Testament, if you brought an animal offering you were confessing to being a sinner, and expecting to be forgiven. As forerunner to the Lamb of God, who would provide the ultimate payment for sin, John represented a transition, from the old to the new."}
