{"verse":"54","text":"And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the moe ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit."}
