Yes, God is able to forgive our sins, but not only ours! He is also able to forgive the sins of people everywhere!"},{"book":"1 John","chapter":"2","verse":"3","text":"I will tell you how we can be sure that we ◄know/have a close relationship with► God.

Instead, I am writing to you a command which was given to you when you first [MTY] believed in Christ. That command is part of the message that you have always heard."},{"book":"1 John","chapter":"2","verse":"8","text":"Nevertheless, I can say that the command I am writing to you is a new command. It is new because what Christ did was new, and what you are doing is new, because you have been ceasing to conduct your lives in a morally impure manner and are now truly conducting your lives in a pure manner. That is like [MET] no longer living in darkness. Instead, it is like living where a brilliant light is already shining."},{"book":"1 John","chapter":"2","verse":"9","text":"Those who claim that they are pure in every way, like people [MET] living in the light, but hate any of their fellow believers, are still behaving in an impure manner, like [MET] people who are continually living in darkness."},{"book":"1 John","chapter":"2","verse":"10","text":"But those who love their fellow believers are continuing to conduct their lives like people who are living in the light.

People desire to possess whatever ◄appeals to their senses/they see or hear about►. People boast about the material things that they possess. Such evil ways of living do not originate/come from the Father!
