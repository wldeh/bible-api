He said, “A certain man planted a vineyard. He built a fence around it in order to protect it. He made a stone tank to collect the juice that they would press out of the grapes. He also built a tower for someone to sit in to guard his vineyard. Then he leased the vineyard to some men to care for it and to give him some of the grapes in return. Then he went away to another country."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"2","text":"When the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent a servant to the men who were taking care of the vineyard in order to receive from them his share of the grapes that the vineyard had produced."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"3","text":"But after the servant arrived, they grabbed him and beat him, and they did not give him any fruit.

But they beat that one on his head, and they insulted him."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"5","text":"Later he sent another servant. That man they killed. They mistreated many other servants whom he sent. Some they beat and some they killed."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"6","text":"The man still had one other person with him. It was his son. He loved him very much. So, finally he sent his son to them because he thought that they would respect him and give him some of the grapes."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"7","text":"But when they saw his son coming, those men who were looking after the vineyard said to each other, ‘Look! Here comes the man who will some day inherit the vineyard!

So tell us what you think about this matter: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not [MTY]? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?”"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"15","text":"Jesus knew that they did not really want to know what God wanted them to do. So he said to them, “◄I know that you are just trying to make me say something wrong for which you can arrest me./Why are you just trying to make me say something wrong for which you can arrest me?► [RHQ] But I will answer your question anyway. Bring me a coin so that I might ask you something after I look at it.”"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"12","verse":"16","text":"After they brought him a coin, he asked them, “Whose picture is on this coin?

It is living people who worship him. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we know their spirits were still alive!

So God considers that this poor widow has put more money into the box than all the other people!”"}]}
